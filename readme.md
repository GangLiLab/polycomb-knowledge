## Somthing about epigenetics

- Epigenetics can be defined as “a **stably heritable phenotype** resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence.
- Practically, the term "Epigenetics" refers to **DNA and chromatin modifications** that persist during cell division
- Epigenetic regulation is essential for **cell fate decisions and cellular function**s.





## What are Polycomb-group proteins?

### Overview

> [wikipedia](https://t.ly/tog-E) 

**Polycomb-group proteins (PcG proteins)** are a family of protein complexes first discovered in fruit flies that can **remodel chromatin** such that epigenetic silencing of genes takes place.

- The mammalian PRC1 core complexes are very similar to Drosophila.

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that catalyses the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me1/2/3). This complex maintains **gene transcriptional repression.**

- **Multiple PcG proteins** can coordinate and **assemble into large multimeric protein complexes** with distinct functions.
- In **mammals**, they form **two major complexes,** namely, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2). 



### Discovery history

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic regulators that function by modifying chromatin. The PcG proteins were originally found in *Drosophila melanogaster* **over 70 years ago.** PcGs were determined as **negative regulators of homeotic (Hox)** genes. Since then, an increasing number of PcG proteins have been identified, from yeast, fungi, plants to animals.



### PRC1

- PRC1 catalyses the monoubiquitylation of histone **H2A at lysine 119** (H2AK119ub1).
- It is required for the Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression



### PRC2

#### units

- PRC2 catalyses the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (**H3K27me1/2/3**).  H3K27me2/3 are closely related to silent genomic regions
- Mammalian PRC2 contains three core subunits: **EZH1/2, EED and SUZ12**
- **EZH2** associates with EED and EZHIP. The catalytic activity of PRC2 relies on the **SET domain of EZH1/2**. But EZH1/2 exhibits no detectable histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity by itself.
- **EED** binds to H3K27me3 and stimulates the enzymatic activity of PRC2
- **SUZ12** functions as a structural platform that stabilizes the PRC2 holoenzyme AND defines distinct PRC2 subcomplexes by **associating with RBBP4/7** and other sub-stoichiometric partners
-  Two alternative subtypes of PRC2, namely, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2
  - PRC2.1 includes one of the Polycomb-like (PCL) proteins–**PHF1, MTF2 or PHF19,** and either **PALI1/2 or EPOP**
  - PRC2.2 contains **AEBP2** and **JARID2**

- tissue-specific PRC2 component **EZHIP**, which can associate with EZH2

#### crucial role

- early embryonic lethality of mice lacking the PRC2 core subunits
- In humans, **germline monoallelic mutations** in PRC2 subunits may cause **multisystem genetic disorders**, such as overgrowth-intellectual disability (OGID) syndromes
- mutation or dysregulation of PRC2 subunits is frequently observed in multiple cancers and diseases: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)

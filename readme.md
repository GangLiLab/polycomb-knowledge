## Somthing about epigenetics

#### Overview

- Epigenetics can be defined as “a **stably heritable phenotype** resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence.
- Practically, the term "Epigenetics" refers to **DNA and chromatin modifications** that persist during cell division
- Epigenetic regulation is essential for **cell fate decisions and cellular function**s.

#### Cis and Trans

- **cis-elements** are DNA sequences that are located on the same strand of DNA as a gene, and they regulate the transcription of that gene. Cis-elements can be located upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the gene, or even within the gene itself. 

- Cis-regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, are regions of non-coding DNA, which regulate the transcription of nearby genes

  - **DNA-binding domain**: A cis-element that is recognized by DNA-binding proteins, such as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers. Examples of DNA-binding domains include the zinc finger domain, the helix-turn-helix domain, and the leucine zipper domain.
  - **Epigenetic marks**: Cis-elements that are not DNA sequences, but rather chemical modifications of DNA or histone proteins that can affect gene expression. For example, DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mark that can silence gene expression by recruiting repressive trans-factors.
  - **Enhancer**: A cis-element that can be located far away from the gene it regulates, and that can increase transcription by binding to specific trans-factors.
  - **Insulator**: A cis-element that can prevent the spread of chromatin modifications and regulate the interactions between cis-elements and trans-factors. Insulators can be located between genes or within genes, and they play a role in maintaining the integrity of chromatin domains.
  - **Promoter**: A common cis-element located upstream of a gene that is recognized by RNA polymerase and other transcription factors to initiate transcription.
  - **Poly(A) signal**: A cis-element that is recognized by the polyadenylation machinery to add a poly(A) tail to the 3' end of an mRNA molecule.
  - **Silencer**: A cis-element that can be located upstream or downstream of a gene, and that can decrease transcription by binding to specific trans-factors.
  - **Polyadenylation signal**: A cis-element located downstream of a gene that signals the addition of a poly(A) tail to the 3' end of the mRNA.
  - **Response element**: A cis-element that is recognized by a specific trans-factor, such as a transcription factor or hormone receptor, to activate or repress transcription in response to a particular signal or stimulus.
  - **RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain**: A cis-element that is located at the carboxy-terminal end of the RNA polymerase II subunit and is involved in the regulation of transcriptional elongation and termination.
  - **Polycomb response element**: A cis-element that is recognized by polycomb group proteins to establish and maintain gene silencing during development and differentiation.
  - **RNA-binding protein motif**: A cis-element that is recognized by RNA-binding proteins to regulate RNA processing, stability, and translation. Examples of RNA-binding protein motifs include the AU-rich element (ARE) and the GU-rich element (GRE).
  - 

- **Trans-factors** are molecules that bind to cis-elements and regulate gene expression. These molecules can include transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins, and other regulatory proteins. Trans-factors can bind to cis-elements located near the gene, or they can bind to cis-elements located far away on the same chromosome, or even on a different chromosome. 

-  trans-regulatory factors regulate (or modify) the expression of distant genes by combining with their target sequences

  - **Alternative splicing factor**: A trans-factor that can regulate alternative splicing of pre-mRNA, which is the process of generating multiple mRNA isoforms from a single gene. Examples of alternative splicing factors include the serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs).

  - **Chromatin remodeling complex**: A trans-factor that can alter the structure of chromatin to regulate gene expression. Chromatin remodeling complexes can move, eject, or reposition nucleosomes to expose or hide cis-elements from trans-factors.

  - **Chromatin modifier**: A trans-factor that can modify chromatin structure by adding or removing chemical marks from histone proteins. Examples of chromatin modifiers include the histone methyltransferases and histone deacetylases.

  - **Chromatin remodeler**: A trans-factor that can alter the structure of chromatin by sliding, ejecting, or repositioning nucleosomes. Examples of chromatin remodelers include the SWI/SNF complex and the ISWI complex.

  - **Chromatin insulator binding protein**: A trans-factor that binds to chromatin insulators and regulates the interactions between cis-elements and trans-factors. Examples of chromatin insulator binding proteins include the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and the boundary element-associated factor (BEAF).

  - **DNA methyltransferase**: A trans-factor that can add a methyl group to cytosine residues in DNA, leading to gene silencing. DNA methyltransferases are involved in the process of DNA methylation, which is an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation.

  - **Histone acetyltransferase**: A trans-factor that can modify histone proteins by adding acetyl groups to lysine residues, leading to a more open chromatin structure and increased transcription. Examples of histone acetyltransferases include the p300/CBP family of proteins.

  - **MicroRNA**: A trans-factor that binds to specific RNA sequences to regulate mRNA stability and translation. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that can base-pair with target mRNAs and inhibit their translation.

  - **Nuclear receptors**: A class of transcription factors that bind to specific cis-elements in DNA in response to hormones, vitamins, and other signaling molecules. Nuclear receptors include the estrogen receptor, the androgen receptor, and the vitamin D receptor.

  - **Polycomb group proteins**: A group of trans-factors that can repress gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. Polycomb group proteins can bind to specific cis-elements and recruit other proteins to create a repressive chromatin environment.

## What are Polycomb-group proteins?

### Overview

> [wikipedia](https://t.ly/tog-E) 

**Polycomb-group proteins (PcG proteins)** are a family of protein complexes first discovered in fruit flies that can **remodel chromatin** such that epigenetic silencing of genes takes place.

- The mammalian PRC1 core complexes are very similar to Drosophila. 

> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13072-020-00369-1

Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a chromatin-modifying enzyme that catalyses the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me1/2/3). This complex maintains **gene transcriptional repression.**

- **Multiple PcG proteins** can coordinate and **assemble into large multimeric protein complexes** with distinct functions.
- In **mammals**, they form **two major complexes,** namely, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and 2 (PRC2). 



### Discovery history

Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic regulators that function by modifying chromatin. The PcG proteins were originally found in *Drosophila melanogaster* **over 70 years ago.** PcGs were determined as **negative regulators of homeotic (Hox)** genes. Since then, an increasing number of PcG proteins have been identified, from yeast, fungi, plants to animals.



### PRC1

- PRC1 catalyses the monoubiquitylation of histone **H2A at lysine 119** (H2AK119ub1).
- It is required for the Polycomb-mediated transcriptional repression



### PRC2

> https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13072-020-00369-1

#### units

- PRC2 catalyses the methylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (**H3K27me1/2/3**).  H3K27me2/3 are closely related to silent genomic regions
- Mammalian PRC2 contains three core subunits: **EZH1/2, EED and SUZ12**
- **EZH2** associates with EED and EZHIP. The catalytic activity of PRC2 relies on the **SET domain of EZH1/2**. But EZH1/2 exhibits no detectable histone methyltransferase (HMTase) activity by itself.
- **EED** binds to H3K27me3 and stimulates the enzymatic activity of PRC2
- **SUZ12** functions as a structural platform that stabilizes the PRC2 holoenzyme AND defines distinct PRC2 subcomplexes by **associating with RBBP4/7** and other sub-stoichiometric partners
-  Two alternative subtypes of PRC2, namely, PRC2.1 and PRC2.2
  - PRC2.1 includes one of the Polycomb-like (PCL) proteins–**PHF1, MTF2 or PHF19,** and either **PALI1/2 or EPOP**
  - PRC2.2 contains **AEBP2** and **JARID2**

- tissue-specific PRC2 component **EZHIP**, which can associate with EZH2

#### crucial role

- early embryonic lethality of mice lacking the PRC2 core subunits
- In humans, **germline monoallelic mutations** in PRC2 subunits may cause **multisystem genetic disorders**, such as overgrowth-intellectual disability (OGID) syndromes
- mutation or dysregulation of PRC2 subunits is frequently observed in multiple cancers and diseases: glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL)

#### prc2-binding regions

- Polycomb response elements (**PREs**) are regulatory sites that mediate the silencing of homeotic and other genes. 
- The most common feature of the mammalian PRC2-binding region is the presence of **CpG islands (CGIs)**. => CpG islands are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide, connected by a phosphate group. These regions are often found <u>near gene promoters</u> and are <u>typically unmethylated</u>, which allows for gene expression. The presence or absence of CpG methylation can affect gene regulation and is associated with various diseases such as cancer.

- In mouse embryonic stem cells (**mESCs**) and human embryonic stem cells (**hESCs**), more than **90%** of the PRC2-enriched regions closely correspond to CGIs or **CpG-rich regions**,  which lack DNA methylation and are adjacent to the transcription start site (TSS) of the promoter in the silenced genes
- several PRC2 facultative subunits, such as JARID2 and PCLs, also exhibit binding preferences for CpG-rich sequences 
- Most mammalian gene promoters contain CGIs, but only a minority are PRC2-positive.
